clean up code?
break down code into classes and functions for better readability
make hold/game/next pieces into one canvas?

have separate play style for ai and player
	player style = holding inputs, auto fall, etc
	ai style = tap input once to move once
	(although i think it already works bc offset)
make button to turn on / off ai

make the actual ai using tensorflow.js
	try to use gpu processing

transition into node.js
